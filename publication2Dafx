(WRITTEN)
To date, most of the research and applications for onset detection methods 
concentrate either offline uses or real-time cases with loose time constraints, 
where the latter have seen the use of a relatively wide range of probabilistic
methods such as deep neural networks and machine learning approaches.            TODO cite alllll
However, the less explored field of performance oriented augmentations for 
regular instruments (more conventional augmentations and smart instruments)      TODO cite vision and smart instuments
requires onset detection to be performed with tighter constraints than the 
aforementioned methods (~20ms) and often require to run on embedded devices like
single boards computers that can be integrated in a smart instrument and have
limited computing power when compared to a regular computer.                     TODO Maybe cite elk, bela, beaglebone
Non probabilistic OD algorithms require some parameter tuning, which can allow 
to reduce false positives and increase general performance.
When developing a smart processing system for an acoustic guitar, we had the 
need to perform efficient OD, with a realonset-to-detection latency smaller than
about 14ms: the tool of choice was the Aubio library.                            TODO: cite Aubio
The Aubio library, orginally developed by Brossier in XXXX and later improved 
throughout the years, offers a real-time OD framework containing implementations
of some of the most relevant non-probababilistic OD methods along with a dynamic 
thresholding algorithm and some improvements that were added along the way, such
as Adaptive Whitening. Many of the parameters of aubio-onset, described in depth TODO Cite Adaptive whitening
in the next sections, were bounded by the problem requirements, however the 
onset method used, the silence threshold and the onset threshold required tuning
in order to get the best performance, which in the context of real-time OD is 
both a low count of false positives/negatives and low detection latency.
Moreover, the distribution of detection latency needs to show as little 
variability as possible, so that the time at which the real onset happens can be
found by subtracting to the detection time a fixed time interval.
In this paper we preset a simple framework for parameter tuning for real-time 
onset detection with Aubio and an automated bio-inspired optimizer that makes 
use of evolution concepts to find the optimal paramter values.                   TODO: EXPAND ON EAs and the one used

[current version] which includes improvements to the original model such as the
addition of Adaptive whitening [] and the corrections to some initialization     TODO Cite Adaptive whitening

Aubio offers 7 different methods

Essentia, similar library (better words) includes these methods:

Mirex best solutions and Superflux missing. (However Mirex is not real-time)

In the end Aubio offers ready to use and no hassle real-time OD.

Even quicker response can be found in hybrid time-spectrum approaches like the 
one used by Turchet [cite], which however tends to improve onset labeling 
precision (timewise) and not necessarily the overall latency                     Check with professor, bettwe not to spit but to show why we don't use it.

On the optimization side, Evolutionary Computation algorithms such as variations
of GA have beed applied successfully in many fields as metaheuristics since they (cite GA)
do not make assumptions on the nature of the problem at hand, lending themselves
to a wide range of problems. (better word ist of problem)
